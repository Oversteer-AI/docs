Oversteer turns any browser task into a reliable, reusable workflow you can run on demand. Describe what you want, let Oversteer capture the steps, and replay them as a deterministic flow that accepts variables like product names, account details, or dates. Each run is observable with screenshots and timings, resilient to small page changes, and protected with least-privilege access and secret handling. Oversteer handles tricky sites with stealth browsing and CAPTCHA bypass so you can automate checkouts, account actions, or data collection without brittle scripts.
