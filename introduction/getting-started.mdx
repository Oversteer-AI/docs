In this guide, we'll cover the basics of using Oversteer and some commonly used terminology on the platform.

## Terminology

- **Flow:** A set of saved steps that make up a browser task used to determinstically create runs triggered through the UI, schedule, or API.
- **Run:** A single execution of a flow with a specific set of inputs, complete with session replay and output.
- **Browser profiles:** Reusable browsing environment for your flows to maintain cookies, sessions, and device location, which helps with authenticated tasks and reduce bot detection.
- **Credits:** Usage currency on Oversteer, calculated by the number of steps, CAPTCHA solving, and stealth modes.
