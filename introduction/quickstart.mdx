1. Sign up or sign in to your workspace.
2. Open Flows and start a new flow. Paste the page you want to automate and describe the task in plain language (e.g., "search for a product and check out with saved payment").
3. Choose or create a browser profile if you need a specific location or a saved login.
4. Preview the suggested steps, mark any fields that should stay variable (names, emails, SKUs), and save the flow.
5. Run it once from the dashboard with sample inputs to confirm it behaves as expected.
6. Reuse the flow with new inputs anytime—manually, on a schedule, or through your existing tools—without rewriting the steps.
