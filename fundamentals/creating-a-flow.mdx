## Context

A flow is the base building block of Oversteer. It is a essentially a saved set of steps that can be used to deterministically run and accomplish web tasks.

## Implementation

Within the Oversteer dashboard, navigate to the **Create** tab and follow the instructions. Once the flow creation is kicked off, wait and watch to see the steps be generated. If the flow is successful, you can continue to [Running a Flow](https://oversteer.mintlify.app/fundamentals/running-a-flow). Otherwise, try creating the flow again, possibly with a more descriptive, step-by-step prompt.

## Configuration

### Required

- **Starting URL:** The initial page the flow should start on. Ideally, this URL is very relevant to the page where the task must be executed.
- **Prompt:** The goal that the flow will attempt to achieve. Ideally, this prompt conveys task intent and includes step-by-step instructions of how to do it.

### Optional

- **Browser profile**: The browser profile the flow will use. Recommended for flows that need authenticated sessions. To do so, users must create a browser profile that is logged in to the desired website and select that at flow creation.
- **Browser location:** The location of the browser proxy used. Recommended for websites that require a certain geographical location to access.
- **Structured output**: Structured JSON schema of what the flow should output. Recommended for web scraping, extraction, and monitoring tasks.
- **Sensitive data:** Sensitive data, such as login information, that the agent may need to complete the task. This data is securely encrypted and protected.
