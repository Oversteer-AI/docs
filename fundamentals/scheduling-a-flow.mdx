## Use Cases

- Checking competitor sites for new features
- Getting latest e-commerce product pricing
- Logging into a site to keep a browser profile updated
- Uploading/downloading a monthly report

## Implementation

Once a flow is created, navigate to the schedule section of the individual flow page. Then, select your cadence ("run every _x_ \<days/weeks/months\>") and when this cadence should start. After that, your flow will continue to run unless the schedule is paused or canceled!

## Change Monitoring

If you'd like alerts on the flow output changing or meeting a specific condition, see our [Change Monitoring](/features/change-monitoring) feature.
