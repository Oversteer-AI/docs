1. Open the flow and switch to the **Schedule** tab.
2. Pick how often to run it—every few minutes, hours, or days—and set when to start.
3. Decide which browser profile and inputs the schedule should use so each run stays consistent.
4. Turn on notifications if you want alerts only when certain conditions are met, and add the email or webhook to notify.
5. Save the schedule. You can pause or resume it anytime and monitor upcoming runs from the same tab.
