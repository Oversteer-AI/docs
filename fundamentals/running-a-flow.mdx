## Overview

Once a flow has been successfully created, you can now run this flow at any given time. You can run a flow via the Oversteer dashboard, schedule, or API.

## Running from Oversteer Dashboard

To run a flow from the Oversteer dashboard, navigate to the flows page. Then, navigate to the individual flow you want to run. The, click "Run" and follow the instructions.

**Configuration**

- **Start URL:** The initial page the flow should start on. In most cases, the default should not be changed.
- **Browser profile:** The browser profile the flow will use. If authenticated session is required to access the site you want to automate, ensure you are using a browser profile that is logged in.
- **Flow variables:** Other variables that the agent has detected as useful configurable variables. This includes search terms, form inputs, etc.

## Running on a Schedule

To run the flow on a scheduled cadence, see [Scheduling a Flow](https://oversteer.mintlify.app/fundamentals/scheduling-a-flow).

## Running via API

To run via API, you can make a `POST` request to `https://api.oversteer.dev/api/runs` with your Oversteer API key, flow information, and other configuration

Here's in example cURL request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.oversteer.dev/api/runs \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "flowId": "YOUR_FLOW_ID",
  "initialVars": {
    "startUrl": "YOUR_START_URL"
  },
  "browserProfile": {
    "mode": "existing",
    "id": "YOUR_BROWSER_PROFILE_ID"
  },
  "delivery": {
    "type": "sync",
    "timeoutMs": 25000
  }
}'
```

**Configuration**

- **flowId: **Id of the flow desired
- **initialVars**
  - **startUrl:** The initial page the flow should start on. In most cases, the default should not be changed.
  - **\<other\>: **Other variables that the agent has detected as useful configurable variables. This includes search terms, form inputs, etc.
- **browserProfile**
  - **mode:** `existing` (at this time, this is the only option that should be used)
  - **id:** Id of the browser profile desired
- **delivery**
  - **type: **One of `sync | poll | webhook` depending on desired API behavior
    - Sync will return a synchronous response or timeout depending on `timeoutMs` 
    - Poll will return a `runId` that can be polled for status at `https://api.oversteer.dev/api/runs/<runId>/poll`
    - Webhook will return a `runId` that can be polled for status and will deliver the finished payload to your webhook endpoint specified
  - **timeoutMs** (required if `type` is `sync`): A timeout for early returning synchronous run results
  - **webhook** (required if `type` is `webhook`)
    - **url**: Your webhook url endpoint
    - **secret**: Your webhook secret that can be used to verify Oversteer signature header
