## Overview

Once a flow is run, you have two main ways to analyze and observe their flow: individual and aggregate analytics.

## Individual Analytics

To access individual analytics on a given run, find the run through the **Runs** page or the **Flow \> Runs** page, then click on the individual run.

On the run details page, you can see:

- Run success
- Run latency
- Result output
- Browser replay
- Steps executed

## Aggregate Analytics

To access aggregate analytics, navigate to the **Analytics** page. Optionally, you can filter down by timeframe and flow.

On the analytics page, you can see:

- Total executions
- Total credits used
- Average latency
  - Note: the latency of the first run of a given flow will take significantly longer than future runs since it must generate the flow steps. This may skew the results.
- Success rate
