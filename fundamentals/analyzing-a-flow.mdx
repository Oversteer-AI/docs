To understand how a flow is performing, open its **Runs** tab. Filter by status or teammate to see recent activity, then drill into a specific run. Each run includes a step-by-step timeline with screenshots, page snapshots, and timings so you can spot slow steps or layout changes. Compare results across versions to confirm updates didn’t break the workflow, and export the run output if you need to share it with stakeholders. Use these insights to adjust inputs, schedules, or the flow itself for smoother automation.
