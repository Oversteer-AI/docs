Change monitoring keeps an eye on a site for you. Set a flow to run on a cadence and describe, in plain language, what counts as a meaningful change—like “price drops below \$50” or “item back in stock.” Oversteer will rerun the flow at that interval and notify you by email or webhook when the condition is met. Pick the right browser profile and inputs so the monitor checks the correct account or location. You can pause alerts anytime, and each monitored run is logged with the usual screenshots and results for quick review.
