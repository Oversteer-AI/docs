## Overview

Change monitoring lets Oversteer users:

- Detect if a page has changed since the last time you scraped
- Get structured data about what has changed
- Receive realtime events on change

## How to Set Up

To get set up change monitoring:

- [Create a flow](https://oversteer.mintlify.app/fundamentals/creating-a-flow) that extracts data you want to track
- [Schedule the flow](/fundamentals/scheduling-a-flow) to how often you want to check for changes
- On the schedule configuration, enter change criteria and event preferences

## Listening to Events

When a change has been detected, users can receive events at:

- Webhook destination
- Email

With these options, developers and non-developers can react quickly to change events.
