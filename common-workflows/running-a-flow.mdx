title: 'Running a flow'

1) Open a saved flow and click **Run**. 
2) Fill in any required inputs (like product names, account emails, or dates). 
3) Choose the browser profile you want to use so the run has the right region and session. 
4) Start the run. You can watch live step updates as Oversteer moves through the flow. 
5) When it finishes, review the screenshots, page captures, timings, and the final results. If something blocked the run, the status will make it clear so you can retry or adjust inputs.
