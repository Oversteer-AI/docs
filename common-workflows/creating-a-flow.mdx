title: 'Creating a flow'
---

1) Go to Flows and choose **Create**. Paste the starting URL for your task. 
2) Describe what you want done in everyday language (for example, “log in, search for a SKU, add the first result to cart, and check out”). 
3) Select or make a browser profile if the task needs a saved login or a specific location. 
4) Review the proposed steps. Mark fields that should stay variable—names, emails, addresses, SKUs, or dates—so the flow can be reused. 
5) Give the flow a clear name and description, then save it. Run a quick test to confirm it behaves correctly before sharing with your team.
